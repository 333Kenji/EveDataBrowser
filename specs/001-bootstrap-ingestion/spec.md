# Feature Specification: CCP SDE ingestion bootstrap

**Feature Branch**: `[001-bootstrap-ingestion]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Load Eve SDE ZIP archives, persist them for browsing, and stand up the shared Docker baseline with manifest rotation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints, SDE touchpoints, manifest expectations, filament UI elements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY, including which Eve SDE datasets/manifest versions they rely on
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üì¶ Document assumptions about data freshness, access roles, checksum/manifest requirements, and compliance
- üé® Reference the filament UI experience (Background Web canvas, card gradients, sidebar layout) in terms of user expectations, not CSS specifics

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Eve SDE archive version or update cadence
   - Checksums/manifest verification expectations
   - Postgres reporting requirements or downstream exports
   - Accessibility expectations for filament UI interactions and Background Web behavior (e.g., reduced motion)
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors (e.g., SDE download failures, manifest mismatches)
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Fleet logisticians need to load the latest CCP SDE snapshot so they can explore blueprint and type information inside the Eve Data Browser without hand-maintaining YAML extracts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the team has a fresh CCP SDE ZIP URL, **When** they trigger an ingestion run, **Then** the system records the source manifest (version + SHA-256), stores parsed type and blueprint data, and confirms success in the activity log.
2. **Given** a previously ingested SDE version exists, **When** the same archive is ingested again, **Then** the system detects the unchanged checksum, skips redundant database updates, and reports that no rotation was required.
3. **Given** a logistics analyst opens the Eve Data Browser UI, **When** they filter by ship category or enter a search term, **Then** the React interface displays matching SDE records with manifest metadata badges.
4. **Given** the ingestion worker cannot find a required SDE asset or detects a checksum mismatch, **When** the run executes, **Then** it aborts safely, preserves the prior manifest, and surfaces a clear failure status for operators.
5. **Given** the CCP static data page layout changes and assets are not discovered, **When** the watcher runs, **Then** it logs a warning, attempts configured fallback mirrors, and pauses ingestion until an operator supplies a valid archive.

### Edge Cases
- CCP static data page layout changes or required files are unavailable ‚áí ingestion must surface a warning, fall back to configured mirror/manual override, and block the run until an operator supplies a valid archive.
- Manifest checksum mismatch between download and stored expectations ‚áí run aborts, prior manifest remains active, and error details are logged.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow maintainers to initiate Eve SDE ingestion runs using official CCP download locations.
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture manifest metadata (version label, download timestamp, SHA-256) for each ingestion attempt.
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist parsed SDE ship and blueprint entities into the authoritative Postgres datastore so the browser can query them.
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose ingestion status and manifest metadata to the data browser API consumers.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a containerized runtime where ingestion, API, and frontend services share access to the `data/sde/` artifacts.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure re-ingesting an identical archive is idempotent and does not duplicate data or manifests.
- **FR-007**: System MUST flag and halt ingestion when required files or checksum validations fail, leaving prior manifest data intact.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow frontend users to see that SDE-backed datasets reflect the latest manifest version and ingestion timestamp.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a React-based filament UI that supports search, filtering, and manifest badge display for ship and blueprint records.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SDE Manifest**: Label combining version string, checksum, source URL, ingestion timestamp, and status; drives manifest rotation decisions.
- **SDE Ship Record**: Metadata drawn from `invTypes` + attributes: type identifier, name, group/category references, race/faction, slot counts, attributes.
- **SDE Blueprint Record**: Manufacturing/reaction blueprint definition, including product identifiers, activities, materials, and times.
- **Filament UI View**: React component library that surfaces searchable tables, manifest badges, and reduced-motion controls backed by ship and blueprint datasets.
